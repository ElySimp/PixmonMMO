# UserStats Duplicate Records Fix Documentation

## Problem
Multiple duplicate records were being created in the UserStats table for the same user in the PixmonMMO game project. This was causing:
- Database bloat
- Potential data inconsistency
- Possible performance issues

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Database Cleanup
- Created scripts to identify and remove duplicate UserStats records
- Retained only the most recent record for each user
- Verified the database is now clean with one record per user

### 2. Prevention Measures
- Added `ensureSingleStatsRecord` method to User.js to check and fix duplicates
- Modified `createUserStats` to properly check for and handle existing records
- Updated `getStats` method to clean up duplicates when encountered
- Added unique index on user_id column to prevent database-level duplicates
- Created server startup script to check and fix any duplicates on server start

### 3. Monitoring and Maintenance
- Created monitoring script to check for duplicates periodically
- Implemented automatic cleanup in the monitoring script
- Added scheduled task to run monitoring daily
- Created logs to track duplicate occurrences over time

## Files Created/Modified

### New Scripts
- `check-and-fix-stats.js` - Runs at server startup to fix duplicates
- `monitor-userstats.js` - Checks for duplicates and logs findings
- `schedule-monitoring.js` - Sets up scheduled monitoring
- `add-unique-constraint.js` - Adds unique index to prevent duplicates
- `check-for-duplicates.js` - Simple script to verify fix

### Modified Files
- `User.js` - Added methods to handle and prevent duplicates
- `authController.js` - Updated to use new methods
- `server.js` - Added startup fixes and monitoring

## How the Fix Works

1. **On Server Startup**:
   - `checkAndFixDuplicateStats()` runs to clean existing duplicates
   - Monitoring is scheduled to run daily

2. **During User Registration/Login**:
   - `ensureSingleStatsRecord()` is called to verify and fix any duplicates
   - Ensures each user has exactly one stats record

3. **Database Level Prevention**:
   - Unique index on user_id column prevents duplicate inserts
   - Error handling in `createUserStats()` gracefully handles constraint violations

4. **Ongoing Monitoring**:
   - Daily checks for duplicates
   - Automatic cleanup if duplicates are found
   - Logging for historical tracking

## Testing and Verification
- Verified through database queries that each user has only one stats record
- Confirmed that the fix handles edge cases like missing records
- Tested that duplicates cannot be created due to unique index

## Future Recommendations
1. Continue monitoring logs for any potential duplicates
2. Consider refactoring other parts of the codebase that interact with UserStats
3. Review other tables for similar duplicate issues
4. Implement additional input validation where appropriate
